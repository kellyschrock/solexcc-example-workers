# Speech Example

The `speech` worker is a simple demo of TTS messages Solex responds to. 

The UI it provides is on the flight screen, a set of 3 buttons:

-   TTS: Plain text-to-speech.
-   Text: TTS voice with a "flash" effect on the flight screen.
-   Error: TTS voice with a temporary "error" view across the top of the flight screen.

## The UI

This also demonstrates putting basic controls on the UI. In this case, the `worker_shot_buttons` identifier is used, indicating that the UI
should appear where the Smart Shots button normally goes on the flight screen when connected to a 3DR Solo.
