# Phasers Example

Romulans: They're a problem. Also, they're fictional, like the phasers controlled by this worker. 

This is really just an example of conditionally displaying something on the flight screen based on whether a feature is enabled ("armed", in this case) elsewhere (in the Solex startup screen, in this case). Once enabled, the `phasers` worker puts a "Phasers" button on the flight screen that can be used to display a full-screen view over the video and map views, allowing you to rain hell fire on the Romulans while still being able to see where you're going. It's also an example of back-and-forth interaction between the UI and a worker.
